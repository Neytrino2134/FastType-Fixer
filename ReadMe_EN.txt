=== NEON RETRO PLAYER - STARTUP GUIDE ===

Hello! This guide will help you run the player, even if you are doing this for the first time and don't know code.

IMPORTANT: You do NOT need Java. You need "Node.js" (they are different things). The player will not run without Node.js.

-----------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: PREPARATION (One time only)
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Download and install Node.js.
   - Go to the official site: https://nodejs.org/
   - Download the version marked "LTS" (Recommended for most users).
   - Run the downloaded file and install it by clicking "Next" through the setup wizard.
   - It is recommended to restart your computer after installation.

-----------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: INSTALLATION (One time only)
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Open the folder containing this player.
2. Find the file named "install.bat" and run it (double click).
3. A black window will open. Don't worry, this is normal.
   - It will automatically download necessary components from the internet.
   - This may take 1 to 5 minutes depending on your internet speed.
   - When finished, you will see "INSTALLATION COMPLETE".
   - Press any key to close the window.

-----------------------------------------------------
STEP 3: LAUNCH (Every time you want to use the player)
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Find the file named "start.bat" and run it.
2. A black window will open — DO NOT CLOSE IT.
   - This is the "engine" of the player. It must stay open for the player to work.
3. Your browser should open automatically with the player running.
   - If it doesn't open automatically, type this into your browser's address bar: http://localhost:5173

-----------------------------------------------------
HOW TO USE
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Add Music: Simply drag and drop audio files (MP3, WAV) from your computer directly into the browser window.
2. Change Background: Drag and drop any image or video file into the player window.
3. Save Settings: In the settings menu (gear icon), click the download button to export a config file (.NRP). You can drag this file back later to restore your theme.
4. Fullscreen: Press the "F" key on your keyboard.

Enjoy the vibes!
