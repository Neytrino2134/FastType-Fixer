Please place your microphone sound effects in this folder.

Expected filenames:
1. mic_on.mp3 (or .wav)  - Played when recording starts.
2. mic_off.mp3 (or .wav) - Played when recording stops (manually or via silence).

Note: The application will look for .mp3 first, then fallback to .wav if not found.
